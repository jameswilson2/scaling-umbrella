                            <li>We shall collect one Monthly Payment in advance for the Services and Equipment that we supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may elect to pay quarterly or annually in advance if you prefer.</li>
                            <li>Payment for Services and Equipment will commence from the date the Services become available to you whether or not you use the Services and Equipment.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Installation fees and initial service charges must be paid at the time of the installation.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>We make a charge for sending you paper invoices; please see the section titled Additional Charges for costs related to paper billing.</li>
                            <li>We reserve the right to suspend any Services in the event that you fail to pay within fourteen (14) days any account notified to you as being in arrears. During any such period of suspension the charges for your Services remain payable in full.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>You agree to reimburse us all costs and expenses incurred in enforcing any clause in this Agreement including but not limited to debt collection costs.</li>
                            <li>At our discretion interest compounded at the rate of two percent (2%) per calendar month or such sum as specified under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (interest) Act 1998 or similar, whichever shall be the higher, may be charged on any account in arrears.&nbsp;</li>
                        </ol>
                   <br>
                    <li><strong>Additional Charges</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Data Limits</strong>: Broadband accounts are provided with an inclusive monthly data transfer limit which can be checked on the portal at any time. In addition, when an account reaches 80% of its monthly data limit a courtesy automated nightly notification email is sent to the email address registered to the account. It is your responsibility to ensure you supply us with an up-to-date email address at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the data limit is exceeded, further data transferred is charged at the amount published in your &lsquo;My Account&rsquo; page for the subscribed Service.&nbsp;<br><br>
              
               If applicable, on the 1<sup>st</sup> of each month we will email you the excess usage charge incurred on your account.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the opportunity to pay for the excess usage within the first 15 days of the month by bank transfer.&nbsp;&nbsp;After this 15 day period, a &pound;10 plus VAT administration fee will be levied to cover administering the account due to late payment.&nbsp;<br><br>
                <p>You are responsible for all data transferred through your account and hence the charges for that data. Data transfer includes any data transferred as a result of spyware and virus activity and it is therefore important that you ensure any devices using your account are kept secure and free from any viruses. You can monitor your daily data usage by logging into your &apos;My Account&apos; page on our website.<br><br>
                  There are no excess usage charges for unlimited accounts but we do apply rate restrictions to ensure good service to all our customers.</li>
               
                        <li><strong>Payments not made by Standing Order</strong>: Our services are priced for Monthly Payments to be made by standing order, should you choose to pay Monthly Payments by other means please note, in line with industry practice, there is a handling charge of &pound;10 plus VAT per month.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li><strong>Reminder Letters</strong>: We will send you reminder letters for late payments for which we may charge you an administration charge of &pound;10 plus VAT per letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid these charges please pay on time.</li>
                        <li><strong>&ldquo;Chargeback Fee&rdquo;</strong>: Where we agree to take payment by debit or credit card and your card payment is subsequently charged back to our account due to unauthorised use of the card or is disputed by the card holder or for any other reason, we shall charge you an administration fee of &pound;50 plus VAT.&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid this charge please ensure you are authorised to use the payment card and that the card is valid.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reconnection Charge</strong>: In the event that your account is suspended for non-payment or you request that the account is suspended, we shall charge you &pound;25 plus VAT for reconnecting the Services. &nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that the Services will only be reconnected upon receipt of the outstanding balance plus the Reconnection Charge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Repositioning for Line of Sight</strong>: Our microwave radio based broadband services rely on line of sight between our mast and the radio receiver installed on your premises.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will install the receiver to ensure line of sight, however, it is your responsibility to ensure line of sight is maintained see clause 5.6 below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we have to reposition the receiver to restore line of sight for your Services, we may charge you for this work.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintenance Charge (Optional)</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Equipment installed at your premises will come with a one-year warranty.&nbsp;&nbsp;We offer a maintenance contract to cover parts and labour for faults that may develop in the Equipment after the first year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maintenance Charge is optional. Please contact us for more details. &nbsp;</li>

                            <li>You agree to ensure that there is no obstruction within your premises between the radio aerial installed on your premises and our mast that reduces or prevents line of sight between the aerial and the mast; this can be caused by growth of trees and plants or by new buildings or other obstructions between the aerial and the mast.&nbsp;&nbsp;We reserve the right to charge you for moving equipment to restore line of sight, see clause 4.6.</li>
                            <li>You agree to operate the Equipment and permit the Equipment to be operated in a proper manner and only by persons who are competent to operate such Equipment.&nbsp;</li>

                    </li>
                         <br>
                    <li><strong>Our Obligations&nbsp;</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We may not change or add to clause 6.4 or Clause 7 except for security, legal or regulatory reasons.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>We may not change or add to any other clause unless it is reasonable to do so.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>We will give you at least one calendar month&apos;s notice of any changes or additions. We will not use this right to vary the terms of any special offer which applies to you and which you have accepted during the term of the special offer.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>After the Minimum Term we may change your Monthly Payment at any time by giving you at least one calendar month&apos;s notice but only once in any twelve-month period, unless it is for a reason set out in clause 6.5. The increase will be capped at the greater of:&nbsp;<br>
                                    <p> a) <5%; or <br>

                            <li>We may increase your Monthly Payment if required by law or if any regulatory authority requests or requires a change to any aspect of our pricing which affects your Monthly Payment directly or our pricing structure generally.&nbsp;</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>Liability&nbsp;</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Neither We nor You are liable for any breach of this Agreement arising from circumstances reasonably beyond the relevant party&rsquo;s control. We and You agree to use all reasonable endeavours to overcome any such problem at the earliest opportunity and to re-commence performance as soon as reasonably possible.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Our liability under this Agreement shall not in any circumstances exceed &pound;100.</li>
                            <li>You accept that due to the nature of email and the internet we can never guarantee delivery or receipt of email. We therefore do not accept any responsibility for any loss You incur through mis-delivery, non-delivery or non-receipt of email. We will endeavour to provide you with Services under your account but there will inevitably be periods when we are not able to offer the Services either due to an unforeseen emergency or due to planned maintenance and improvement works. We cannot therefore guarantee access to your account at all times and do not accept any responsibility for any loss arising from any &ldquo;down time&rdquo; but will endeavour to warn you regarding scheduled, non-urgent down time for maintenance and improvements.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>You are responsible for checking any material that you download from a website using your account and any email that you may receive for viruses, worms and other computer code which may have a negative effect on the use of your computer. We recommend that you maintain an up-to-date virus-checker but would point out that no such checker will be fully comprehensive as new viruses and such like are being created all the time.</li>
                            <li>Equipment supplied by us is pre-configured for your account. If you have purchased third party equipment then our liability to support that equipment is restricted to the supply of usernames and passwords for your account. We will use reasonable endeavours to get your services up and running on broadband via telephone support, but should this not be possible then labour charges will be levied for an engineer call out to your premises. Should the engineer discover that the visit was needed due to a fault on the telephone service, or with faulty equipment supplied by ourselves, then those charges will be cancelled. Should you decide to use a third-party technician to get your computer equipment connected to the internet, then any charges levied by said third party will be borne solely by yourself and we will not under any circumstances become liable for any of those charges even if it is discovered that there is a fault on the phone service or with Equipment supplied by ourselves.&nbsp;</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>Cancellation, Suspension &amp; Termination&nbsp;</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>For periods of absence from your property of one calendar month or more you may suspend your broadband Service from our customer portal found on your My Account page on our website.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the suspension period you will not be charged for the Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Service can be reactivated from the portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reactivation fee payable if you manage the deactivation and reactivation from the portal.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>You (and We) may cancel your Services at any time. Cancellation must be done in writing giving at least one month&rsquo;s notice. Any termination notice by email shall be deemed to be accepted if We confirm receipt.</li>
                            <li>If you terminate without notice or cause us to terminate in accordance with our rights in this Agreement, payments will be due until the date that termination would have been effective had proper notice been served. No part month payments or refunds will be entered into at any time.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>We may terminate your account if you commit a material breach of this Agreement. We reserve the right entirely at our discretion to suspend your account instead of terminating it. We also reserve the right to suspend your account if required to do so by the government, the police or other administrative, military or intelligence authority (irrespective of whether such authority is entitled to require us to do so).</li>
                            <li>If We exercise our right to suspend your account, this does not waive our right subsequently to terminate your account for the same conduct.</li>
                            <li>In the event of termination You will not be entitled to a refund of your subscription fees or equipment supply and installation fees. In addition any fees invoiced but not yet settled must be paid in full without offset.</li>
                            <li>In the event of lawful suspension of your account, We will not be liable to refund your subscription fee in whole or in part.</li>
                            <li>Where a Minimum Term contract period has been chosen, the services may not be cancelled within this period. The contract may however be cancelled within this period providing payment is made in full for the remainder of subscriptions due under the contract should it have been allowed to run the full period.</li>
                            <li>Where a service is provided over a BT telephone line, there will be a charge for cancellation of the service. This charge covers the cost of a BT Openreach engineer unjumpering the telephone line and will be charged at the rate applicable at the time of cancellation. No charge will be levied if the service is migrated to an alternative provider rather than being cancelled unless the new provider does not use the BT network (LLU provider).</li>
                            <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; 8.10.In the case of you wishing to move to an alternative supplier, then this will be treated as a termination. All fees due under the contract shall be payable and no fees paid or invoiced in advance shall be refunded.</li>

                    <li><strong>Privacy Policy Overview</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We do not, during the normal course of business, sell the database of our account holders to third parties. However, in the event that our shareholders decide to dispose of a majority of the shares in the company or in the event of a sale of the company&rsquo;s assets or subsequent liquidation of the company, that database may be made available to third parties. Insofar as it may be within our control to do so, we will endeavour to ensure that they observe terms similar to those set out in this clause 9.</li>
                            <li>We will use our database of all account holders for marketing our own products and from time to time, where we believe it may be beneficial to all account holders to do so, we may also send you information on the products and services of other companies.</li>
                            <li>When you register details with us or make an order or access account details, we use a secure service. Any data you give us is encrypted using a &ldquo;Secure Socket Layer&rdquo; (SSL) session. SSL is an industry standard and is one of the best ways to ensure internet messages are not intercepted. You should be aware, however, that not all browsers can use SSL. Please be sure you use an appropriate browser.</li>
