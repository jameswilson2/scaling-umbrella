<h2 class="h1"><span class="colour">How does it work?</span> Our microwave delivered broadband internet service is specifically designed to deliver superfast broadband to rural communities where the distance from the exchange means that traditional phone line delivered services are either slow, intermittent or totally unavailable. Speeds up to 50Mb/s are possible. </h2>
<p>For businesses with requirements such as multi-site linking we can offer symmetrical options (SDSL equivalent) with virtual private networks (VPN), Internet CCTV for monitoring premises, WiFi hotspots and other internet based products. </p>
<p>With the advances in voice over IP (VOIP) technology, we can now deliver telephony services over broadband therefore reducing the need for a normal telephone line. </p>
<p>We understand the frustrations of communities who do not have access to broadband and we will work with you to implement an effective solution. For a project to be economically viable we require a minimum number of subscribers. This in turn is determined by the network infrastructure we would need to install to make the service available. </p>
<p>At the users premises we install a small radio aerial, about the size of a sandwich box, to enable you to receive our microwave broadband service. We usually paint the aerial so that it is unobtrusive. </p>
