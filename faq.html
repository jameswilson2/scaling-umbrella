        <div class="accordion-body"><h4>How can I change my Service Plan?</h4>
<p>You can change your Service Plan at any time by logging in to your account on our website. Service plans are updated at midnight on the last day of the month.  Alternatively, you can call or email our sales team to regrade services for you.</p>

<h4>What does my monthly data usage include?</h4>
<p>
    Your data usage is measured against what you download from the Internet and what you upload. It is important to note that this is not just storing a file or document from a website but also covers activities such as, streaming videos or television programs and listening to radio stations over the Internet. The list below is a guide to activity that is classed as data usage that will be counted towards your usage allowance. </p>
            <p>General Internet browsing<br>
Receiving and reading e-mails<br>
Downloading files such as movies and music<br>
Listening to online radio stations<br>
Online gaming<br>
Watching videos and TV programs on sites such as BBC's iPlayer, YouTube and TikTok<br>
Watching Netflix, Amazon Prime or similar movie/TV streaming services<br>
Emailing or uploading photos<br>
Live streaming/recording CCTV over the Internet</p>


<h4>What happens if I exceed my data usage allowance?</h4>
<p>
The monthly data limit is determined by the type of service you have selected. Each service level has its own limit and you can find your current limits by logging into your account.
</p>

<h4>Unlimited Data
</h4>
<p>
Many of our service plans come with unlimited data.  There are no excess charges for accounts that have unlimited data but we do set rate caps.  Once your usage exceeds the rate cap for your service, the speed is slowed down to 2.5Mb/s which is sufficient to stream one device.</p></div>

    </h2>
    <div id="flush-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingTwo" >
      <div class="accordion-body"><h4>Can I use my own router?</h4><p>
You may use your own router if it is compatible with our network.  We will provide you with the required settings, but we cannot provide technical support for the router.</p>

<h4>What does installation cost and what does it include?
</h4><p>
Our standard installation charge for our fixed wireless (microwave) services is £350 which includes the cost of a survey, radio, wireless router, cabling (up to 20 metres) and labour. There is no charge for our survey if we cannot supply you a service.<br>
We can advise connection charges for services dependent on third party networks such as BT Openreach when you make an enquiry.


<h4>What does the installation involve?
</h4><p>
For a typical installation of our fixed wireless service we install a radio externally (usually near the chimney) and a router where you would like your broadband connection to be in your premises. We will paint the external equipment to make it less obtrusive if you so wish.
          </p>

<h4>What is line of sight?</h4><p>
Line of sight means the radio that is installed onto your premises has to have an unobstructed view of one of our network masts. Our survey will confirm whether we can obtain line of sight before we commence the installation.

          <h4>Fault Management</h4><p>
We have a number of procedures and processes in place to ensure that all network faults are managed in a timely manner. Customer issues are dealt with as a priority when an issue arises.<br>Response times vary depending on priority defined at issue report stage and/or service level agreement (SLA).</p>
          
          <h4>Monitoring and Alerts</h4>
          <p>Our monitoring platform monitors devices every 5 minutes and is running 24/7 to ensure we have a full overview of the network at any time. Using proprietary network management tools and industry standard network management software our engineers are able to diagnose issues quickly.  We prioritise fixing network issues ahead of individual connections and for widespread outages we prioritise fixing major network nodes over secondary nodes.
</p>
          
          <h4>Network Contention
</h4>
<p>Our continuous monitoring allows our engineers to graph and view traffic from connection origination points in the network, allowing the engineers to cross-reference customer requirements with current network trends. This ensures contention does not become an issue.<br>
Our network is designed to maintain connections on failed links and to use backup connections automatically when failure occurs thereby keeping our customers online during times of failure or upgrades.  At such times you might experience reduced speeds.<br>
Our monitoring is consistently looked at each day by our engineers ensuring that problems are dealt with as quickly as possible.
</p>
          
          <h4>Network Outages</h4>
          <p>We advertise network outages on our outgoing message when you call our main number.  <br>
We have standby power installed at all of our network nodes to ensure continuity of service during power outages.</p>
          
          <h4>Speed Testing and Network Testing</h4><p>We use built in functions of vendor equipment to speed test our connections.  These tests are done each time a connection is installed and showed to the customer on first connection.  We also speed test each radio on our network at 3am every morning.   We use speed test data to ensure each customer’s radio is performing correctly.</p>
          
          <h4>Support Procedures</h4>
          <p>
We have a support phone number that is a direct line to our engineers to help with any issues.  This number is manned during business hours from 8am to 5:30pm Mon to Fri, 10am to 4pm on Saturday and Sunday.<br>

Out of hours we maintain a voicemail system.  Each morning these voicemails are checked by our engineers.  You may also email support@kencomp.net to report any issues with your service.<br>

We provide status updates of ongoing issues or faults using our network status message that can be listened to by calling our support number.<br>

We also inform customers, verbally and via email, of additional charges, before an engineer is booked to carry out any work.

          <h4>How do I pay for your services?</h4><p>
The cheapest way to pay for broadband services is by monthly standing order. We do accept other forms of payment but we have to make an additional charge to cover our administration costs. The current administration charge is shown on our Terms and Conditions page.
For one-off payments we accept cheques, credit & debit card payments and online payments.

          <h4>How long does it take for a new order to be completed and service available?</h4><p>
We expect to deliver your broadband service as quickly as possible; however as we install our equipment externally we require dry weather and this can sometimes cause a delay.
</p>
          
          <h4>I am a customer with another Internet Service Provider, how can I move to Kencomp Internet?</h4>
          <p>If you wish to use our fixed wireless (microwave) service we can connect you without any delay. Remember to cancel any other broadband services with your existing ISP.<br>

If you wish to transfer to our network using your BT phone line broadband or BT fibre you can move to Kencomp Internet for a one off installation charge (please call our sales team for current pricing).</p>
          
          <h4>Is your support based within the UK?</h4>
          <p>Yes! In fact, all our staff are highly trained in dealing with our products and services and our offices are based in Kendal.
</p>
          
          <h4>What broadband services do you offer?</h4>
          <p>We offer a range of services using ultrafast fibre and fixed wireless (microwave) broadband for your home or business.<br> 
Our corporate broadband services are ideal for larger businesses who regularly utilise technologies such as video-conferencing and virtual private networking.<br>
We also offer VOIP telephone solutions for home and business. <br> 
For customers wishing to use their BT phone line for broadband we offer the whole range of fibre and full fibre services.
</p>
          
         <h4>What is the minimum contract length for your broadband services?</h4>
          <p>For fixed wireless connections where the installation charge has been paid upfront the minimum term of our contract is 3 months.  For fibre and copper line based services the term is dependent on the contract entered into at the time of connection.</p>
          
          <h4>Why are my overnight downloads disrupted?</h4>
          <p>The Kencomp system automatically logs off each user account at 3am. We do this so we can provide customers with a day-by-day account of how much data they have used.  We also test radio performance at this time.<br>
The connection is only disrupted for a few minutes but this may disrupt downloads. We recommend customers use a download manager that can automatically resume downloads or to start any large overnight downloads well before 3am or after 3.30 am.

          <h4>Why is my broadband speed test not showing the speed I subscribe for?
</h4><p>
The full speed would be obtained under perfect conditions with no contention. However, a number of factors can prevent the full speed from being reached.</p><p>
A speed test shows the speed available but if some of the speed is being used the speedtest will show the remaining speed available.  An accurate speedtest can only be conducted with no other usage on the service.</p><p>
In order to provide broadband cost effectively, all broadband is contended. This means that bandwidth (speed) is shared between a number of users and at peak times can mean some users do not receive the full speed.  Other reasons could include:</p><p>
Slow/old devices<br>
Computers infected with viruses or spyware <br>
Badly configured internal network that includes poor Wi-Fi and cabling<br>
Background updates such as Windows updates or antivirus updates<br>
Background Peer to Peer file sharing (such as Torrents, etc.)<br>
The maximum speed of the website you are viewing, its contention and the route through the Internet to the website.
