<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
              <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
<p>We are committed to maintaining the highest degree of integrity in all our dealings with potential, current and past clients, both in terms of normal commercial confidentiality, and the protection of all personal information received in the course of providing the business services concerned. We extend the same standards to all our customers, suppliers and associates. As a minimum, we adopt procedures and practices in keeping with EU GDPR.</p>
<h4>Ethics</h4>
<p>We always conduct our own services honestly and honourably, and expect our clients and suppliers to do the same. Our advice, strategic assistance and the methods imparted through our training, take proper account of ethical considerations, together with the protection and enhancement of the moral position of our clients and suppliers.</p>
<h4>Duty of care</h4>
<p>The internet services we provide, along with our actions and advice will always conform to relevant law, and we believe that all businesses and organisations should avoid causing any adverse effect on the human rights of people in the organisations we deal with, the local and wider environments, and the well-being of society at large.</p>
<h4>Contracts</h4>
<p>Our contract will usually be in the form of a contract covered by our general terms and conditions. These terms will be provided to you at the point on order or delivery and are available to view from our website at any time. The quality of our service and the value of our support provide the only true basis for continuity. We always try to meet our clients' contractual requirements, and have measures in place for you to easily and simply let us know if you have a problem or complaint about the service we provide to you.</p>
<h4>Fees</h4>
<p>Our fees are always competitive for what we provide, which is of high quality and often tailored to your needs. As such we do not generally offer arbitrary discounts; generally a reduction in price is only enabled by reducing the level or extent of services to be delivered. That said, we always try to propose solutions which accommodate our clients' available budgets and timescales. Wherever possible we agree our fees and basis of charges clearly in advance, so that we and our clients can plan reliably for what lies ahead.</p>
<h4>Payment</h4>
<p>We expect our bills to be settled in a timely manner as set out in our order and general terms and conditions. Late or overdue payments may result in your service being suspended or stopped and you may be required to pay a reconnection fee. If you have a problem in making a payment, we ask that you contact us immediately so that we can discuss this with you and avoid disruption to your service. &nbsp;Full contact details are listed at the end of this document.</p>
<h4>Intellectual property and moral rights</h4>
<p>We retain the moral rights in, and ownership of, all intellectual property that we create unless agreed otherwise in advance with our clients. In return we respect the moral and intellectual copyright vested in our clients' intellectual property.</p>
<h4>Quality assurance</h4>
<p>We maintain the quality of what we do through automated and professional network monitoring as well as feedback from our clients. &nbsp;We make every effort to keep you connected to our network and to the outside world in line with our published service level agreement (SLA) relating to your contract. However, we are not in control of the wider internet and cannot guarantee that all services will be available all of the time. If you do have a problem, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can help. Full contact details are listed at the end of this document.</p>
<h4>Professional conduct</h4>
<p>We conduct all of our activities professionally and with integrity. We take great care to ensure that any work we carry out at your property is performed safely, using professional equipment and tools and to the highest standards available. Our team is well trained and we expect anyone who you are in contact with to act professionally and honestly and we expect the same in return. You will always be treated respectfully and courteously but our staff are instructed to disengage with anyone who is abusive or rude. We promise to deal with you at every stage in a professional manner, but if you have any concerns, please contact us immediately. &nbsp;Full contact details are listed at the end of this document.</p>
<h4>Equality and discrimination</h4>
<p>We always strive to be fair and objective in our advice and actions, and we are never influenced in our decisions, actions or recommendations by issues of gender, race, creed, colour, age or personal disability.</p>
